For anyone reading this I'm not the best with Python and this did take a while to do since I'm not as skilled 
This is a little adventure type game I made one without the fighting aspect and one with it as an improvement
A lot of changes had to be made to the improved version but Overall I think it is ok as a start
The game consists of navigating throughout the dungeon where the player starts off in the Hall and must enter compass commands to move around the dungeon and into other rooms
They are able to take any items that have been found in any of the rooms they have entered through the command 'take'
There are also random fights throughout the dungeon where the player will have to battle with enemies and fight with the item they have equipped
The main goal is to get to the Boss room where the dragon is located and defeat the dragon to complete the game. 
Very easy task I don't know how else to add any complextity to the game to make it different each playthrough
